## How It Works

### Input Parameters
1. **Hourly Wage**: Current hourly rate for inventory workers
2. **Hours per Week**: Weekly hours worked by each employee
3. **Number of Workers**: Total employees involved in inventory management
4. **Annual Inventory Shrinkage**: Current annual losses from shrinkage
5. **Total Inventory Value**: Total value of inventory being managed
6. **Inventory Count Frequency**: How often inventory is counted per month

### Calculation Logic

#### Labor Savings
```
Current Annual Labor Cost = Hourly Wage Ã— Hours per Week Ã— 52 weeks Ã— Number of Workers
iVMI Annual Cost = (Base Cost + Per Worker Cost) Ã— 12 months
Labor Savings = Current Labor Cost Ã— 0.8 (80% reduction)
Net Labor Savings = Labor Savings - iVMI Cost
```

#### Shrinkage Reduction
```
Shrinkage Savings = Annual Shrinkage Ã— 0.2 (20% reduction)
```

#### Efficiency Gains
```
Hours Saved per Count = 2 hours (average)
Annual Counts = Count Frequency Ã— 12 months
Efficiency Savings = Hours Saved Ã— Annual Counts Ã— Hourly Wage Ã— Workers Ã— 0.5
```

#### Total Savings
```
Total Annual Savings = Net Labor Savings + Shrinkage Savings + Efficiency Savings
```
